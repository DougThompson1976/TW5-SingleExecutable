description: Select which tiddlers are synced with the server

''Note:'' This feature in new and relatively untested. Changing the filter
changes what can be saved and may have unintended concequences.

You can change the filter listed in [[$:/plugins/OokTech/MultiUser/ExcludeSync]]
to change what is saved by the wiki. The filter returns tiddlers that won't be
saved by the wiki.

So anything you change in a tiddler returned by that filter is not saved
between wiki refreshes and isn't sent to the server.

The default filter is:

```
[has[draft.of]][prefix[$:/state/]][prefix[$:/temp/]][[$:/StoryList]][[$:/HistoryList]][[$:/status/UserName]][[$:/Import]][[$:/plugins/OokTech/MultiUser/Server Warning]]
```

''Note 2:'' The server has a corresponding filter for what gets sent to
browsers but I haven't made an interface to edit that filter yet.
