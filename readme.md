! This is a demo of some tiddlywiki plugins

Tiddlywiki github repo https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5

! Instructions

Download the executable for your system and copy it to where you want your wiki
to be. And then run it. (On osx or linux you may have to make it executable)

When you run it than it will create a wiki folder for you and start the wiki
server and then open up the wiki in your default browser.

The default tiddler should have some instructions.
